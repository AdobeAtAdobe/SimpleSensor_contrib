 *  Helps us to get the first Location under a Device path in AEM screens
 *  just take the devicepath from the screens client lib and then take that path and do a get on it with .screenlocation.json on that request
 *  this will return either an error or a json serialized version of that location node.  Which is where we store some data for tuning client side applications per location
